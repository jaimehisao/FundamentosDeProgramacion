# Fundamentos De Programacion - Tec de Monterrey  Programming Fundamentals - Tec de Monterrey
This is a place where I upload all my code from my Programming Fundamentals Class, in C++.
This repo is meant to be a place to store my code for future personal reference, and also to see my progress as time goes by.

By no means are this the most efficient solutions to the given problems as certain conditions had to be taken into consideration as per the course syllabus. Specific requirements for the projects may include, but are not limited to: Parameters by Reference, Arrays instead of Vectors, no C++ functions (create our own), or the solution not being the fastest one.

If you are going to use my code please reference it or just use it as a guide. I am by no means liable for any misuse of this code for academical and non academical purposes.
